# Week 02

- Interprocess Communication : Connect some process in same computer
- Shell is used to access kernel
- Redirect ```stdout``` from a process to a file using ```>```
- Piping ```stdout``` from earlier process to ```stdin``` in the next process using ```|``` 

## System Calls

### Definition

System call is a door to access the kernel which is used by the application program.

- It can switch from user mode to kernel mode 

### Execution

- Use a wrapper function to initiate a kernel function, such as preparing memory and the register
  - Wrapper function split into 2 part
    - Kernel Mode
      - There is a **trap handler** for giving a function to wrapper function and also switch from user mode to kernel mode or vice versa
      - **Trap handler** call the requested function in the register and memory stack 
    - User Mode

## File I/O Model

- Some functions :
  - open()
  - read()
  - write()
  - close()

### Default File Descriptor

| name   | code |
| ------ | ---- |
| stdin  | 0    |
| stdout | 1    |
| stderr | 2    |

## Program

- Program is a combination of multiple process.
- Program usually is an executable and already compiled to binary code

## Process

- We can see our process we use ```ps``` command
- ```kill``` command is sending TERMINATE signal to targeted process
- Steps :
  - Initialization
  - Request Memory to OS with kernel
  - Create a virtual memory
  - Kernel manage the memory

### Memory Layout

1. Stack : A part where the size is affected by process
2. Heap
3. Shared Libraries
4. Global Data
5. Static Data
6. Text Segment

## Static and Shared Libraries

- Command ```ldd``` is used to know shared dependencies

### Static Libraries

- *.a format
- Static link
- The library is directly implemented to the source code

### Shared Libraries

- *.so format
- Dynamic link
- The library is not directly implemented to the source code

## Interprocess Communication and Synchronization

### Types

| Name       | Example                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Signals    | SIGINT, SIGTERM                      |
| Pipes      | ls -al \| grep [keyword]             |
| Sockets    | Ip - port                            |
| File locks | apt                                  |
| IPC        | semaphores, shared memory, msgqueues |

## /proc directory

### Definition

An interface to kernel data structures in a form that looks like files and directories

- To get process detail access ```/proc/<pid>```
  -  In that folder we can see the command to execute that process in ```cmdline``` file
  - Also we can see active file descriptor in ```fd``` directory
  - We can see ```environ``` file to see active environment variable when we executing a program

## Error Handling System Call

- Detect using return value
