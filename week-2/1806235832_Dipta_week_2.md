# Week 02

## System Calls

- Interprocess Communication : Connect some process in same computer
- Shell is used to access kernel
- Redirect ```stdout``` from a process to a file using ```>```
- Piping ```stdout``` from earlier process to ```stdin``` in the next process using ```|``` 

## File I/O Model

- Some functions :
  - open()
  - read()
  - write()
  - close()

### Default File Descriptor

| name   | code |
| ------ | ---- |
| stdin  | 0    |
| stdout | 1    |
| stderr | 2    |

## Program

- Program is a combination of multiple process.
- Program usually is an executable and already compiled to binary code

## Process

- We can see our process we use ```ps``` command
- ```kill``` command is sending TERMINATE signal to targeted process
- Steps :
  - Initialization
  - Request Memory to OS with kernel
  - Create a virtual memory
  - Kernel manage the memory

### Memory Layout

1. Stack : A part where the size is affected by process
2. Heap
3. Shared Libraries
4. Global Data
5. Static Data
6. Text Segment

## Static and Shared Libraries
