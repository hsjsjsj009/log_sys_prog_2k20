# Week 12

## Kernel Compilation and Boot Sequence

In this week i learn about how to compile a kernel and how to install it into my OS. When i compile and install the kernel, most of the time was spent on waiting the kernel compilation finished, it took almost 1 hour in my virtual machine with 4 cores and 4700 MB RAM. After the compilation, it produced 2 file, the first file was kernel header file and the second file was kernel image, the image and header didn't contain the driver module so I need to install the driver module with the compiled module in the kernel folder.

I need to register the kernel to the GRUB and modify the GRUB configuration, according to my knowledge, GRUB is like a bootloader picker in my computer that tell my UEFI which kernel that should UEFI execute and give the all hardware access to that kernel. After i set the grub, i need to update the initram, for the boot system.  Initram is a scheme to load kernel file to the memory for boot preparation.

After we set all the GRUB and initram, i restart the OS and choose my kernel. In this kernel compilation topic, i didn't found many error, i executed the command easily and sometimes i did another job while i was compiling kernel because the compiling process took a lot of time.
