# Week 03

## Redirection

### stderr to file

cmd 2> err.txt

### stdout and stderr to file

cmd &> out.txt

### stderr to stdout

cmd 2>&1

## System Call

- stat = Get the detail of a file
- open = open a file and return the file descriptor
- write = write some data to an active file descriptor
- ioctl = give a signal to an i/o file descriptor
- read =  read some data from an active file descriptor
- lseek = move file descriptor cursor to the given index

## Universality of I/O

- All of the I/O in linux have a file that represented each I/O.
- All of the I/O that were accessed by user in linux were represented using file descriptor
  - We get the file descriptor from opening an I/O represented file using open() system call
  - After we use it, we close the file descriptor using close() system call
- If we want to get the data or write some data in an I/O, we must include the file descriptor
