# Processes

- Is a Part of a program
- Each process has Process ID and Parent Process ID
- To see process use `top` or `ps`

## `ps` command

### Column Field

- PID = Show the pid
- USER = Show the user that execute the process
- PR = Show the priority of the process
- NI = Show `nice` value
- VIRT = Show the amount of Virtual Memory that the process use
- RSS = Show the amount of Real Memory that the process use
- S = Show the process state
- %CPU = Show CPU Utilization
- %MEM = Show the ratio of the RAM usage of the process
- TIME+ = Show the accumulate CPU time of the process from the process start
- COMMAND = Show the command to start that process

## Program

- Contains many process
- Information inside a program
  - Binary format identification
    - assembler output
    - COFF : common object file format
    - ELF : executable and linkable format
  - Program entry point
  - Data
  - Shared libraries
  - Symbol and relocatable tables
  - Machine language

## `kill` Command

- Give turn off signal to a process according to the pid

## OS Init and PID

- OS will execute init first when start up
- PID 0 - 300 is reserved by kernel process 

## `nohup` Command

- Make a process still running when the parent has been killed, it makes a process to be orphaned and change the parent process to init when the parent is terminate

## Kind of Process

### Orphaned Process

A process that has no parent process because the parent process has terminated or finished

### Daemon Process

An intentional orphaned process, usually for long term process and running in the background

### Zombie Process

A process that already finished but not reaped by parent process so that the process still active an registered in the process table

## Process State

- Running (R)
- Interruptible Sleep (S)
- Uninterruptible Sleep (D)
- Stop (T)
- Zombie (Z)
- Dead (X)

# Memory

Component

- Page Table
- Physical RAM

## Virtual Memory

- Help a process to gain physical memory space
- Can help when a process need shared memory

## Command Line Arguments

- argv = list of arguments
- argc = number of arguments

## `brk()` and `sbrk()`

- For changing data segment size
- `brk()` sets the end of the data segment
- `sbrk()` increments the program data space

## `malloc()` and `free()`

- `malloc()` for creating a memory space
- `free()` clear the memory space
