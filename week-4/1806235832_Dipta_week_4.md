# Processes

- Is a Part of a program
- Each process has Process ID and Parent Process ID
- To see process use `top`

## Program

- Contains many process
- Information inside a program
  - Binary format identification
    - assembler output
    - COFF : common object file format
    - ELF : executable and linkable format
  - Program entry point
  - Data
  - Shared libraries
  - Symbol and relocatable tables
  - Machine language

## `Kill` Command

- Give turn off signal to a process according to the pid

## OS Init and PID

- OS will execute init first when start up
- PID 0 - 300 is reserved by kernel process

Component

- Page Table
- Physical RAM

## Virtual Memory

- Help a process to gain physical memory space
- Can help when a process need shared memory

## Command Line Arguments

- argv = list of arguments
- argc = number of arguments

## `brk()` and `sbrk()`

- For changing data segment size
- `brk()` sets the end of the data segment
- `sbrk()` increments the program data space

## `malloc()` and `free()`

- `malloc()` for creating a memory space
- `free()` clear the memory space
